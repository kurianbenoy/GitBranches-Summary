## Algorithm of my git branch

1. Check if current directory is a git repositary, else check path to something else
2. If not there, then git clone a banch
3. List all branches
4. In each branch, list the last commit, total commits, author, list authors who commited, summary of authors who commited
5. Stop with bare minimum
